    <p class="para">To remove a word from the todo list, first click on the word to cross it out. Then, click on the word again, and a
    prompt will appear asking if you want to remove the item from the list. If you type "Yes," the item will be removed. If
    you type "No," the item will remain on the list. If you click on the item again after selecting "No," the prompt will
    appear again. Only "Yes" or "No" can be entered in the prompt.
    
    Additionally, if you try to submit an empty input form, an alert will appear prompting you to type something.</p>
